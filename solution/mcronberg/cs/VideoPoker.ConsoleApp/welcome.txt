Welcome to Video Poker
----------------------

This is a simple implementation of the classic Video Poker game 'Jacks or Better'. 
The goal of the game is to get a hand containing at least a pair of Jacks or better 
to win. The game starts with the player being dealt five cards from a standard 
52-card deck. The player then has the option to 'hold' any of the five cards and 
discard the rest. The discarded cards are replaced with new ones from the same 
deck, constituting the final hand of the player. The player's final hand is then 
evaluated, and if it contains a pair of Jacks or a higher-ranking poker hand 
(like two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, 
straight flush, or royal flush), they receive a payout according to the 
game's paytable. The simplicity of 'Jacks or Better' makes it an ideal introduction 
to the strategy and fun of Video Poker. Read more about the game at

In this 'Jacks or Better' Video Poker game, you start with $25. The unique twist is 
that you can only bet $5 per hand, making each decision crucial. You aim to build a hand 
of at least a pair of Jacks to win. If your hand doesn't meet this threshold, you lose 
your bet. Winning hands pay out according to the game's paytable, adding to your balance. 
The game ends when you run out of money, so strategic play and careful betting are key to 
prolonging the game and maximizing potential winnings.
